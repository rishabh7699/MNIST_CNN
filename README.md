# MNIST_CNN
This is a project on Handwritten Digit recognition (MNIST Dataset) using a Convolution Neural Network. 
Network have been implemented using tensorflow.

Activation function used in each layer of network is ReLU. Optimizer used is Adam with learning rate of 0.001.

Accuracy of model reached upto 98% on test Dataset and 99.9% on train Dataset.
